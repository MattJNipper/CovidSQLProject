# CovidSQLProject

This repo is a showcase of some of my SQL knowledge for my portfolio as a data analyst. Please feel free to look through the code to get an idea of my experience  with SQL.

The data that accompanies this SQL code is in the excel files in the repo and was originally found at https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.
